# SwiftRegex [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

SwiftRegex is a regular rxpression micro framework written in pure Swift. The goal is to make it compatible with Linux and other POSIX compliant systems. Of course donâ€™t use it in apps where you have access to NSRegularExpression.

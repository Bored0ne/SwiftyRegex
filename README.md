# SwiftyRegex [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

SwiftyRegex is a regular expression micro framework written in pure Swift. The goal is to make it compatible with Linux and other POSIX compliant systems. Of course donâ€™t use it in apps where you have access to NSRegularExpression.

# Example

```swift
// Use shorthand operator to test for match
"http://something.com/users/13/profile" =~ "/users/[0-9]"

// Get matching substrings
let words = "RegEx is tough, but useful."
Regex("[a-zA-Z]+").matches(words)

// Replace matching substring
Regex("<name>").replace("Hi <name>.", with: "Jane")
```
